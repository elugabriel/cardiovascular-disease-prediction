            <h2>Cardiovascular Disease Information</h2>
            <p>
                Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a class of diseases that involve the heart or blood vessels.
                It is the leading cause of death worldwide. Common CVDs include coronary artery disease, heart failure,
                valvular heart disease, and more. It's important to maintain a healthy lifestyle and regular checkups
                to reduce the risk of CVD.
            </p>
            <h3>Common Types of CVD</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): A narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries that can lead to heart attacks.</li>
                <li>Heart Failure: When the heart is unable to pump blood effectively, leading to fluid buildup and other symptoms.</li>
                <li>Stroke: A sudden loss of brain function due to a disruption in the blood supply to the brain.</li>
                <li>Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD): Narrowing of the blood vessels outside the heart and brain, often in the legs.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Prevention and Lifestyle</h3>
            <p>
                You can reduce your risk of CVD by maintaining a healthy diet, regular exercise, not smoking, and managing stress.
                It's also essential to monitor blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and seek medical advice for early detection.
