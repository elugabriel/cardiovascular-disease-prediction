            <h2>Cardiovascular Disease Information</h2>
            <p>
                According to the CDC, heart disease is one of the leading causes of death for 
                people of most races in the US (African Americans, American Indians and Alaska Natives, 
                and white people). About half of all Americans (47%) have at least 1 of 3 key risk factors 
                for heart disease: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking. Other key indicator 
                include diabetic status, obesity (high BMI), not getting enough physical activity or drinking too much alcohol. 
                Detecting and preventing the factors that have the greatest impact on heart disease is very important in healthcare. 
                Computational developments, in turn, allow the application of machine learning methods to detect "patterns" 
                from the data that can predict a patient's condition.

            <h3>Common Types of CVD</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Coronary Artery Disease (CAD):</strong> CAD is the most prevalent type of CVD. It occurs when the coronary arteries
                     that supply blood to the heart muscle become narrowed or blocked due to the buildup of fatty 
                     deposits (atherosclerosis). This can lead to chest pain (angina) or heart attacks (myocardial infarctions).</li><br>

                <li><strong>Hypertension (High Blood Pressure): </strong>Hypertension is a chronic condition in which the force of blood 
                    against the artery walls is consistently too high. Over time, high blood pressure can damage the arteries
                    and increase the risk of other cardiovascular complications such as heart attacks, stroke, and heart failure.</li><br>

                <li><strong>Heart Failure:</strong>Heart failure is a condition in which the heart cannot pump blood effectively to meet the body's needs. 
                    It can develop as a result of various heart conditions, including CAD, high blood pressure, or heart valve disease.</li><br>

                <li><strong>Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD):</strong>PAD involves the narrowing or blockage of arteries in the limbs, most commonly in the legs. 
                    This condition is often associated with atherosclerosis and can lead to reduced blood flow, causing pain and muscle weakness.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Prevention and Lifestyle</h3>
            <p>
                You can reduce your risk of CVD by maintaining a healthy diet, regular exercise, not smoking, and managing stress.
                It's also essential to monitor blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and seek medical advice for early detection.
